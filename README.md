# Dataset Overview

This dataset contains access point connection data from the Federal University of Juiz de Fora. It includes the following information:

- timestamp: The time at which the user connected to the access point.
- connection_time: The length of time the user was connected to the access point.
- host: A unique integer identifier for each user.
- access_point: A unique identifier for each access point.

This dataset can be used for various purposes such as:

- Network Usage Analysis: Studying patterns in how users interact with the university's wireless network.
- User Behavior Modeling: Analyzing how students and staff engage with the campus's internet infrastructure.
- Resource Allocation and Optimization: Helping IT departments optimize network resource distribution based on usage patterns.
- Machine Learning: Building predictive models or performing clustering tasks related to user connectivity behavior.
